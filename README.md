  Hello Stranger!
</h1>
<h2>What is this project?</h2>
<p>This project was a copy of an old site of Accelerator App, an enterprise that Manage a Software for incubbators and accelerators. This site was made entirely for show knowledge and to learning.</p>
<h2>Why I am here?</h2>
<p>ThatÂ´s a good question. If you are looking for a handmade site with a touch of what we called in Brazil "gambiarra" you came for the right place, and don't even waste time looking for this word, no one was capable of translating yet.</p>
<h2>Serious Stuff<h2>
<h3>1 - Framework used<h3>
<p> I used GatsbyJs on version 4.20 to do all this project from the beggining, so I installed some Gtsby Plugins and also React Libraries. For CSS I use styled Components, but you can do the same job with Sass or just pure CSS.
<h3>2 - Gatsby Plugins:<h3>
<ul>
<li>gatsby-plugin-styled-components</li>
<li>gatsby-plugin-image (Extreme useful)</li>
<li>atsby-plugin-sharp</li>
<li>gatsby-source-filesystem (Very useful)</li>
</ul>
<h3>3 - React Libs</h3>
<li>normalize.css</li>
<li>nuka-carousel</li>
<li>react-icons</li>
<li>styled-components</li>
<h3>4 - How do I build tihs project?</h3>
Its in fact very simple first you need to install the Gatsby CLI, you can find the tutorial on https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-0/ or just be sure that you have node and git installed and run the command:

    npm install -g gatsby-cli

Then go main directory of this project, open a terminal and run two commands in sequence:

    npm install

and:

    gatsby develop

Now you just have to browse http://localhost:8000/ and see the content of the project.
